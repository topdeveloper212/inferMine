(** Pool of parallel workers that can both receive tasks from the orchestrator process and start
    doing tasks on their own. Unix pipes are used for communication, all while refreshing a task bar
    periodically.

    Due to ondemand analysis, workers may do tasks unprompted (eg, when analysing a procedure, a
    process will typically end up analysing all its callees). Thus, children need to update the main
    process (which is in charge of the task bar) whenever they start analysing a new procedure, and
    whenever they resume analysing a previous procedure. This is more complicated than what, eg,
    `ParMap` can handle because of the bidirectional flow between children and parents.

    The children send "Ready" or "I'm working on task <some string>" messages that are used to
    respectively send them more tasks ("Do x") or update the task bar with the description provided
    by the child.

    See also {!module-WorkerPoolState}. *)
